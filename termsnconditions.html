<font size="3">Welcome to Customised Art, a project by <a href="www.aawproductions.com">Artist At Work Productions!</a> By using the website, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully:</font><br>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><font size="3">
  <li>
      <b>Privacy :</b> 
        We will not share your personal information with anyone so you can chill! We understand how annoying it is receive junk/spam mails, so we will always respect your privacy.<br>
  </li>
   <li>
<b>Request an order :</b> 
We at Artist At Work Productions take upon us the responsibility to deliver an artwork tailor-made just for you! That is why we need some time to ensure that we will be able to deliver it to you. Once you place an order, you will receive a notification from us within 24 hours if your order is confirmed.<br>
  </li>
   <li><b>Prices :</b>
    If you are wondering why the prices are not displayed with the products, it is because the price is different for every product and depends on the customisation required. You will receive a notification regarding the price along with the confirmation of the order.<br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Payment :</b>
     Because every order is unique and our artists work very hard to ensure you get what you wanted, we need you to complete your payment before we can begin the process. Do not worry, we promise we will deliver what we promise to!<br>
     </li>
     <li><b>Packaging :</b>  All artworks are packed securely in a mail tube! Since we are customers ourselves, we know how frustrating it can be when the packaging is not quite right.<br>
     </li>
     <li><b>Delivery :</b> You will be notified as soon as your product is ready to be dispatched. However, it is extremely difficult for us to accept responsibility for the services of the courier company. If you do not receive your product within our specified delivery dates, then you must notify us within 10 days and we will take care of it!<br>
     </li>
     <li><b>24/7 WhatsApp support :</b> We know how frustrating it can be to connect with numerous helpline numbers when all you want to ask is one simple question. To make this easier for you, we are available on WhatsApp 24/7 to help you with all your queries. (Realistically. After all, we need to sleep too!)<br>
     </li>
    <li><b>International Copyright Laws :</b> The arrangement and compilation of all Website Content is our exclusive property and is protected by international copyright laws.<br>
    </li>
  </font>
  </ul>
  <font size="5"><b>Refunds</b></font><br>
  <font size="3">


Because we provide you with customised products, it is possible that the expectations do not meet the results. Therefore, we will keep you in the loop during the entire process so that you know what we will be delivering to you.<br> 


If your goods are damaged or if you receive an incorrect product, we would happily provide you with a full refund. 
In case of damaged / incorrect product:</font>
<ol type="1"><font size="3">
<li>
<b>1.</b> Email customised@aawproductions.com with “Returns” in the subject field (within 24 hours of delivery of the product).
</li>
<li>
<b>2.</b> Describe in as much detail as possible the damage to your product and attach photographic evidence detailing the damage to the product.
</li>
<li>
<b>3.</b> We will contact you within 24 hours to take further steps to initiate your refund.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
Just to be fair, we would like to advise you to choose carefully, we do not give refund simply because you changed your mind as our artists customise these orders to suit your needs.<br> <br>

If you ever have any questions, queries or just feel like it, please mail us at customised@aawproductions.com.
